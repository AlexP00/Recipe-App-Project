                <h3>Hamburger</h3>
                <p>Hamburger (abbreviated burger) is a type of sandwich in a round bun, and the same word can also be
                     used for sliced ​​beef steak, which is most often placed in a bun when making such a sandwich.
                   Meat steak, which is the basic ingredient of a hamburger, is usually accompanied by vegetables such 
                   as lettuce, onions and pickles, as well as various sauces such as ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise, and
                    hamburgers in which a few slices of cheese are added to the previously mentioned ingredients are also 
                    popular. Hamburger with cheese is also called "cheeseburger", since "cheese" means cheese in English.

                <h3>Pizza</h3>
                <p>Pizza (ital. pizza) is a specialty of Italian cuisine, usually made of thin,
                     round dough on which, in addition to tomato sauce, you can find different types 
                     of cheese, meat, toppings, and fruit. The inventiveness of the taste can be complemented
                      by the inventiveness of the layout composition on the pizza, which can be arranged in the
                       form of ornaments or other interesting figures. By the way, this dish is considered particularly
                        characteristic of Neapolitan cuisine. Today, pizza is very popular in the world, primarily because 
                        of its cheap and easily available ingredients and ease of preparation.

                <h3>Pasta</h3>
                <p>Pasta or pasta is a group name for all specialties made from cut or dried dough, prepared from flour,
                     eggs, salt and water. It is eaten all over the world, and it is assumed that its birthplace is Italy 
                     or China. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the collective noun macaroni is incorrectly used colloquially, 
                     although it refers to noodles or pasta of all possible shapes and forms. Pasta is originally eaten boiled
                      in salted water, and at the end of cooking a previously prepared sauce is added to it or the sauce is 
                      cooked with the pasta until it is ready. Pasta is the main food of Italian cuisine.

                <p>Sushi is the name for a Japanese dish that consists of two essential parts: boiled rice with
                     the addition of rice vinegar (shari) and rice additives (neta). Neta toppings (mostly fish
                      and seafood) as well as the shape of the sushi can vary a lot; however, one thing that all s
                      ushi has in common is chari (rice with vinegar). Serving only fresh and raw meat is called 
                      sashimi, and is a completely different dish from sushi.

                <p>Ćevapcici or kebabs are a dish made from minced meat, shaped into small rolls and grilled. 
                    Most often, they are made from mixed beef (70%) and sheep (30%) meat. They occur in all 
                    parts of the Balkans, especially in the former Yugoslavia where the Turks ruled. The types 
                    of meat differ from place to place, and often from the religion that prevails in a region.
                     They can also be found as a type of fast food in bread and with side dishes (most often onions and cream).

                <h3>Ice-Cream</h3>
                <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener,
                     either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries
                      or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the
                       freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. 
                       It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together.

                        траке сланине се додају тако да печено месо увек остаје сочно и хрскаво.
